# sCLSVOF integrated with two-phase mass transfer
The simple coupled level set with volume of fraction (sCLSVOF) solver integrated with transport of species allowing to account mass transfer between two-phases.
The code is constructed for OpenFOAM v4.1. The sCLSVOF is obtained from T. Yamamoto et al., 2016 work (https://doi.org/10.1002/fld.4267) and the transport of species is based on H Marschall et al., 2012 paper (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2012.02.034). 
To compile the solver, run ./Allwmake.
